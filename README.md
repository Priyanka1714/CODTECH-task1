Project Overview: Library Management System

Objective:
The Library Management System (LMS) is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage library resources, including books, magazines, and DVDs. The system ensures smooth operations for both librarians and patrons, facilitating resource management, borrowing, and return processes while incorporating robust search capabilities, user role functionalities, and data persistence mechanisms.

Key Features:

Resource Management:

Add, update, or delete items (books, magazines, DVDs).
Assign metadata such as title, author, category, and availability status.
Borrowing and Returning:

Check out resources with real-time availability status updates.
Record item returns and calculate overdue fines automatically.
Search and Filter:

Search library resources by title, author, or category.
Advanced filters for narrowing down resource selections.
User Role Management:

Librarian Role: Full control over library resources and user accounts.
Patron Role: Limited access to search and borrow items.
Overdue Fine Management:

Automatically track due dates for borrowed items.
Calculate and display overdue fines for delayed returns.
Data Persistence:

Use databases (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) or file handling (e.g., serialization) for data storage and retrieval.
Support for backup and recovery operations.
User Interface:

Console-based or graphical interface (e.g., Swing or JavaFX).
User-friendly navigation for seamless interactions.
Implementation Approach:

System Design:

Design the system with an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, creating classes for items (Book, Magazine, DVD), users (Librarian, Patron), and utility functions.
Database Integration:

Implement data storage using JDBC for database interactions or file handling techniques for lightweight solutions.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Enforce role-specific permissions and access restrictions.
Business Logic Implementation:

Integrate core features, including borrowing logic, overdue fine calculation, and dynamic resource updates.
Interface Development:

Develop a clean and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and usability.
Project Deliverables:

Source code with modular design adhering to Java OOP principles.
Functional database or file-based storage solution.
Comprehensive documentation covering system design, usage, and deployment.
Test cases to ensure feature robustness and reliability.
This Library Management System ensures efficient library operations and an enhanced user experience while serving as a comprehensive solution for modern library resource management needs.
